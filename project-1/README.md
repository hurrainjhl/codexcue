## GUI Calculator

The GUI Calculator is built using the `tkinter` library and provides a graphical interface for performing arithmetic and scientific operations.

#### Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Scientific Operations**: Reciprocal (1/x), Square (x²), Square Root (²√x), Negation (±)
- **Clear and Backspace**: Options to clear the current input or remove the last character.

### Running the GUI Calculator

1. Ensure Python and the `tkinter` library are installed on your system.
2. Save the file as `gui_calculator.py`.
3. Run the file using the command:
   ```bash
   python gui_calculator.py

### CLI Calculator
The CLI Calculator is a command-line tool that performs basic arithmetic operations.

#### Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

#### Running the CLI Calculator
Save the file as cli_calculator.py.
Run the file using the command:
```bash
python cli_calculator.py
```
#### Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. tkinter (for GUI Calculator)


### Conclusion
This project demonstrates fundamental Python programming skills, including GUI development with tkinter and command-line interaction.
Both calculators provide a foundation for understanding basic programming concepts and can be extended for more complex applications.
